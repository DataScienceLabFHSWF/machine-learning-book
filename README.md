Readings will be drawn mainly from my [notes](https://github.com/MrIckyThump/programming_python/tree/main/notes) and notebooks. Additional readings may be assigned from books, blogposts, and tutorials.

## Supplemental textbooks ##

These books will deepen your understanding of the material.

To pass this course you will need to take part in the final exam. To pass the exam, 50% of the possible points need to be collected. No supplementary material is required during the exam. More details will be provided during class.

Depending on the current situation, the exam will be either a written or an oral test.

Attendance will not be taken, but **you are responsible for knowing what happens in every class**. If you cannot attend class, make sure you check up with someone who was there.

Respect your classmates and your instructor by preventing distractions. This means be on time, turn off your cellphone, and save side conversations for after class. If you can't read something I wrote on the board, or if you think I made a mistake in a derivation, please raise your hand and tell me!

**Using a laptop in class is likely to reduce your education attainment**. This has been documented by multiple studies, which are nicely summarized in the following article:

I am not going to ban laptops, as long as they are not a distraction to anyone but the user. But I suggest you try pen and paper for a few weeks, and see if it helps.

## Collaboration policy

One of the goals of the assigned work is to assess your individual progress in meeting the learning objectives of the course. You may discuss the homework and projects with other students, but your work must be your own -- particularly all coding and writing. For example:

- It is allowed to discuss ideas of implementation, problems and concepts. How do algorithms work? What is the difference between various implementations? Which is the more efficient or elegant solutions.

- Solutions should not be copied from others but rather demonstrate one's own capability of solving a task or an issue. It is not acceptable to solve parts and exchange these with other students. Each code must be one's own contribution.

Using other people’s text or figures without attribution is plagiarism, and is never acceptable.
