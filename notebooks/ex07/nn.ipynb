    "In this task you have to implement a neural network from scratch. And just like in the exercise before, where you had to implement a perceptron, you again have to tackle this task without the utilization of any frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.  \n",
    "The goal of this task is to verify your manually calculated results, thus you should print out the necessary information during the training process of the network. Besides that your class should implement the following methods:\n",
